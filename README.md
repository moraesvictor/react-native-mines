# Minefield Game

This is a minefield game implemented using React Native.

## Project Description

The minefield game is a classic game where the player needs to uncover all the cells on the grid without detonating any mines. The grid consists of cells that can either be empty or contain a mine. The player can open a cell to reveal its content or flag a cell suspected of containing a mine. The game ends when the player uncovers all the empty cells or uncovers a cell with a mine.
